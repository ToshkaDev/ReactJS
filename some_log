Insatlled Nodejs this way:
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

Steps to create project:
npm init
npm install react react-dom --save   [save means production dependency]

npm install webpack webpack-dev-server babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react babel-preset-stage-2 --save-dev

webpack - to bundle packages
webpack-dev-server  - to create simple server
babel-loader - to convrs ES6 code to ES5 code.
three other packges define "which ES6 command I will use" kinda thing:
babel-preset-es2015 - logic which transpiler (converter, babel in this case) needs, es2015 is ES6
babel-preset-react - react specific logic babel needs
babel-preset-stage-2 - to have extra features like destructuring.
--save-dev - to install all these dependencies as development dependencies.


Regarding package.js:

{
  "name": "reactjs-basics",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "description": "Basic ReactJS",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
//with this I only have to run in the terminal: npm start
    "start": "npm run build",
    //webpack -d mean in dev mode; with all these files the webpack-dev-server will be launched.
    //We confiuring webpack-dev-server with --content-base src/, which means that app content is in src/
    //and this important for development.
    //--inline - how server will run or display everething, --hot is for hot reloading.
    //we can put --port as well. Deafult port is  8080
    "build": "webpack -d && cp src/index.html dist/index.html && webpack-dev-server --content-base src/ --inline --hot",
    //in prod mode source files will be removed and some other files as well
    "build:prod": "webpack -p && cp src/index.html dist/index.html"
  },
